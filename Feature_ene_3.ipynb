    "However, there is another type of nominal encoding called label encoding, where each unique category value is assigned a numerical label. Label encoding can be useful in situations where the categorical values have an inherent order or ranking, such as rating scales or levels of education.\n",

    "For example, in a dataset of job applicants, we might have a feature for the level of education, with values such as high school, bachelor's degree, and master's degree. We could use label encoding to assign numerical labels to each of these values, with high school as 1, bachelor's degree as 2, and master's degree as 3.

The number of new binary features created for each column would depend on the number of unique category values in each column.\n",
    "Let's assume that the first categorical column has 4 unique category values, and the second categorical column has 6 unique category values. To perform one-hot encoding on these columns, we would create 4 new binary features for the first column (one for each unique category value), and 6 new binary features for the second column (again, one for each unique category value). Each row in the original dataset would then be represented by the original three numerical columns, as well as the 4 binary features for the first categorical column and the 6 binary features for the second categorical column.\n",
