Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, polynomial regression can model more complex relationships.\n",

In linear regression, the relationship is assumed to be linear, while in polynomial regression, the relationship can be non-linear and can take on a more complex shape. Polynomial regression allows for more flexibility in modeling the relationship between the variables and can provide a better fit to the data when the relationship is non-linear."
