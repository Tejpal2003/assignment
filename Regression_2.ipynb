    "R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a commonly used metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the explained variance (sum of squared deviations of the predicted values from the mean of the dependent variable) by the total variance (sum of squared deviations of the actual values from the mean of the dependent variable). The resulting value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, R-squared can be calculated as:\n",
    "###### R2 = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) and SStot is the total sum of squares (the deviation of each actual value from the mean of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is interpreted as the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. For example, if R-squared is 0.75, it means that 75% of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. The remaining 25% of the variability is due to other factors not accounted for in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R-squared does not indicate the causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables, nor does it indicate the accuracy or reliability of the model. Therefore, R-squared should be used in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in a linear regression model. Regular R-squared increases as the number of independent variables in the model increases, even if the additional variables do not improve the fit of the model. Adjusted R-squared corrects by penalizing the addition of unnecessary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is calculated as:\n",
    "###### Adjusted R2 = 1 - [(n-1)/(n-k-1)]*(1-R2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where n is the number of observations and k is the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjusted R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model, just like regular R-squared. However, unlike regular R-squared, adjusted R-squared considers the number of independent variables in the model & gives a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared can be used to compare different linear regression models that have different numbers of independent variables. When comparing two models, the model with the higher adjusted R-squared value is considered to have a better fit, given the number of variables in the model.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared is generally more appropriate to use than regular R-squared when comparing the goodness of fit of linear regression models that have different numbers of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular R-squared can be misleading when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables because it always increases as more variables are added, even if the additional variables do not improve the fit of the model. This means that a model with a higher R-squared value may not necessarily be a better fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables that do not improve the fit of the model. As a result, adjusted R-squared can give a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit of the model and is a better metric to use when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that adjusted R-squared is not a perfect metric and should not be the only factor used to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model. Other factors, such as residual plots, statistical significance of the independent variables, and the overall model fit, should also be considered."

    "Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. It works by adding a penalty term to the objective function of the linear regression model, which encourages the coefficients of the model to be small or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso regularization penalty is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This means that it can shrink the coefficients to zero, effectively selecting only the most important features in the model. This makes Lasso regularization a useful technique for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, where there are many irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Ridge regularization, also known as L2 regularization, adds a penalty term to the objective function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients. This penalty shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but does not set them to exactly zero. This means that Ridge regularization is less effective at feature selection than Lasso regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding whether to use Lasso or Ridge regularization, it is important to consider the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis. Lasso regularization is more appropriate when there are many features in the dataset and it is suspected that only a few of them are important for the target variable. In this case, Lasso regularization can effectively perform feature selection and improve the interpretability of the model. Ridge regularization is more appropriate when there are many features that are all likely to contribute to the target variable, but the coefficients may be noisy or highly correlated. In this case, Ridge regularization can reduce the variance of the coefficients and improve the stability of the model.\n",

    "Regularized linear models are a type of machine learning model that help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function. The penalty term encourages the coefficients of the model to be small, which reduces the complexity of the model and helps to prevent it from overfitting in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a linear regression problem where we want to predict the price of a house based on its size and number of bedrooms. We have a dataset of 1000 houses with their prices, sizes, and number of bedrooms. We can use this dataset to train a linear regression model to predict the price of a new house based on its size and number of bedrooms.\n",

    "However, if we include too many features in the model, such as the year the house was built, the style of the house, or the distance to the nearest park, the model may become too complex and overfit the training data.

    "While regularized linear models are useful for preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of linear regression models, they have some limitations that can make them less effective in certain situations. Here are some of the limitations of regularized linear models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited flexibility: Regularized linear models are linear models, which means they can only capture linear relationships between the features and the target variable. In situations where the relationship between the features and the target variable is highly non-linear, regularized linear models may not be the best choice.\n",
    "Feature selection limitations: While Lasso regularization is useful for feature selection, it can also be overly aggressive in some cases, setting some coefficients to zero even if they are important for the target variable. Ridge regularization, on the other hand, does not perform feature selection, which means that it may not be the best choice when there are many irrelevant or redundant features in the dataset.\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning: Regularized linear models have hyperparameters that need to be tuned, such as the regularization parameter alpha in Ridge and Lasso regression. Tuning these hyperparameters can be time-consuming and requires cross-validation, which can add computational overhead.\n",
    "Limited interpretability: Regularized linear models can be less interpretable than non-regularized linear models because the coefficients are shrunk towards zero. This means that it may be more difficult to understand the exact relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",
